# TohoCybersecurity
**Overall To-Do**
- Decide if we want to render to a slideshow or a lot of pages (a lot of pages would be a different .qmd for each page where a slideshow would be one file but less flexibility on use)
- Design interface (Julio, idk how. you do it if you dont mind) - orange header with tabs for each challenge, toho logo, black background for body, white text for body
- Need to finalize names for each person
- Create image logo for each person using AI and save to repo

## Home page
- introduction on top
- list of the five characters - each has a link for their challenge if you click them

## List of five pages for each challenge

### Challenge 1 - Peet with Flete
- fishing email - page looks like an email or notification of pete asking for people to look at the new vehicle inspection requirements
- if you click it you fail, you pass if you click a "report as phishing" button at the bottom


### Challenge 2 - Ghoulio
- game to input password to see how long it would take to crack - can use shiny library to design the input and interface
- need to google how long it takes to run x number of passwords. calculate number of possibilities/ time for each to get result.
- need to come up with criteria for weak, strong, moderate

### Challenge 3 - Psycho Miko

### Challenge 4 - Jackie (Hackqueline(?) and her character has an axe or something?)

### Challenge 5 - Rowland (I cant think of any puns with rowland or welch)
