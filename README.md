Welcome to the Password Fortification Calculator! This interactive tool shows you exactly how strong your passwords are against hackers.

It reveals the huge, exponential difference that simple choices—like adding one extra character or a capital letter—can make. It's built on the principle that more variety and more length means more security:

## Home page
- introduction on top
- list of the five characters - each has a link for their challenge if you click them

## List of five pages for each challenge

### Challenge 1 - Peet with Flete
- fishing email - page looks like an email or notification of pete asking for people to look at the new vehicle inspection requirements
- if you click it you fail, you pass if you click a "report as phishing" button at the bottom


### Challenge 2 - Ghoulio
- game to input password to see how long it would take to crack - can use shiny library to design the input and interface
- need to google how long it takes to run x number of passwords. calculate number of possibilities/ time for each to get result.
- need to come up with criteria for weak, strong, moderate

### Challenge 3 - Psycho Miko

### Challenge 4 - Jackie (Hackqueline(?) and her character has an axe or something?)

### Challenge 5 - Rowland (I cant think of any puns with rowland or welch)
